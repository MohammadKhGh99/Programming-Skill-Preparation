# 1 - Suppose you have a grid of n x m cells, where each cell is either empty or contains a rock.
#     You're given a starting position in the grid (x,y), and you want to reach a target position (tx,ty),
#     but you can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and you can only move through empty cells.
#     You're also given a limited number of moves k that you can make. Write a program to determine if it's possible to
#     reach the target position from the starting position within k moves.
#     Example:
#     n = 3, m = 3
#     grid = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
#     start = (0, 0)
#     target = (2, 2)
#     k = 6
#     Output: true
